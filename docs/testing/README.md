# Testing Strategy

This document outlines the testing approach for the Event Management System.

## Testing Layers

The application employs a comprehensive testing strategy with multiple layers:

1. **Unit Tests**: Testing individual functions and components in isolation
2. **Integration Tests**: Testing interactions between components
3. **End-to-End Tests**: Testing the entire application flow
4. **Manual Testing**: User-driven exploration testing

## Test Technologies

- **Jest**: For unit and integration testing
- **React Testing Library**: For component testing
- **Cypress**: For end-to-end testing
- **MSW (Mock Service Worker)**: For API mocking

## Unit Testing

### Component Testing

All React components should have unit tests covering:

- Rendering with different props
- User interactions (clicks, form inputs)
- State changes
- Error conditions

### Utility Function Testing

All utility functions should have tests for:

- Expected inputs and outputs
- Edge cases
- Error handling

## Integration Testing

Integration tests focus on interactions between:

- Components and context providers
- API calls and data processing
- Form submissions and validation

## End-to-End Testing

End-to-end tests should cover critical user flows:

- User authentication
- Customer management (create, search, update)
- Event management (create, view, edit)
- Booking workflow
- SMS notification triggers

## API Testing

API endpoints should be tested for:

- Successful responses
- Error handling
- Authentication requirements
- Data validation

## Test Coverage Goals

- Unit Tests: >80% coverage
- Integration Tests: Critical paths covered
- E2E Tests: All main user flows covered

## Test Organisation

Tests should be organised according to the following structure:

```
/src
  /components
    /ComponentName
      ComponentName.jsx
      ComponentName.test.jsx
  /utils
    utilityFunction.js
    utilityFunction.test.js
/cypress
  /e2e
    userFlows.cy.js
```

## Mocking Strategy

- **API Responses**: Use MSW to intercept and mock API calls
- **Third-Party Services**: Mock Twilio service responses
- **Authentication**: Mock Supabase Auth functionality

## Test Data

Maintain consistent test data fixtures for:

- Customers
- Events
- Bookings
- SMS messages

Store fixtures in a `/src/__fixtures__` directory.

## Continuous Integration

Tests should run automatically on:

- Pull requests
- Merges to main branch

## Manual Testing Checklist

Before each release, perform manual testing of:

- Mobile responsiveness across devices
- SMS notification delivery
- Twilio webhook handling
- Form validation edge cases
- Performance with large datasets

## Accessibility Testing

Include accessibility testing as part of the testing process:

- Screen reader compatibility
- Keyboard navigation
- Colour contrast
- Form labeling

## Performance Testing

Monitor and test for performance issues:

- Page load times
- API response times
- Rendering performance with large datasets

## Testing Best Practices

1. Write tests before or alongside feature development
2. Keep tests simple and focused
3. Use descriptive test names that explain what is being tested
4. Avoid testing implementation details
5. Test both happy paths and error conditions
6. Ensure tests are deterministic and don't depend on external services
