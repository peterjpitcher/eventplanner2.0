# Implementation Notes - Event Planner 2.0

## SMS Confirmation Feature Implementation (Phase 1)

### Overview
We have successfully implemented the SMS confirmation feature for bookings. This feature allows sending automatic SMS notifications to customers when a booking is created or updated. The system also tracks SMS delivery status and provides a UI for resending confirmations if needed.

### Components Implemented

1. **SMS Service (`src/services/sms-service.ts`)**
   - Created a standalone service to handle all SMS-related functionality
   - Implemented functions for sending, tracking, and querying SMS messages
   - Added phone number formatting and validation
   - Simulated SMS delivery for testing purposes (can be replaced with a real SMS provider)

2. **Logger Utility (`src/lib/logger.ts`)**
   - Developed a centralized logging system with support for different log levels
   - Added namespacing to distinguish logs from different parts of the application
   - Configurable via environment variables

3. **SMS Status Component (`src/components/bookings/sms-status.tsx`)**
   - Created a reusable component to display SMS delivery status
   - Supports 'sent', 'failed', 'pending', and null states
   - Includes tooltip for additional information
   - Configurable size and label options

4. **Tooltip Component (`src/components/ui/tooltip.tsx`)**
   - Implemented a reusable tooltip component using Radix UI
   - Provides consistent styling and behavior for tooltips throughout the application

5. **Booking Form Updates**
   - Added an SMS toggle option to the booking form
   - Enhanced the UI with clear explanations of the SMS functionality
   - Improved form validation for booking creation

6. **Booking Service Updates**
   - Updated the booking service to integrate SMS sending with booking creation
   - Added error handling and validation for SMS sending
   - Implemented a function to resend confirmation SMS messages

7. **Booking Detail Updates**
   - Enhanced the booking detail view to show SMS status
   - Added a button to resend SMS confirmations
   - Improved visual feedback for SMS status

### Database Changes
SMS messages are tracked in a new `sms_messages` table with the following structure:
- `id`: Unique identifier
- `booking_id`: Reference to the booking
- `message_type`: Type of message (e.g., 'booking_confirmation')
- `message`: The content of the SMS
- `status`: Current status ('sent', 'failed', 'pending')
- `sent_at`: Timestamp when the SMS was sent
- `recipient`: Phone number of the recipient

### Environment Configuration
Added new environment variables:
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SMS_ENABLED`: Toggle to enable/disable SMS functionality
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_LOG_LEVEL`: Set the application logging level

### Next Steps (Phase 2)

1. **SMS Reminders**
   - Implement scheduled SMS reminders for upcoming events
   - Add 24-hour and 7-day reminder options

2. **SMS Templates**
   - Create a template management system for SMS messages
   - Allow customization of SMS content

3. **SMS Analytics**
   - Develop a dashboard for SMS delivery statistics
   - Track SMS usage and success rates

4. **Bulk SMS Sending**
   - Enable sending SMS messages to multiple recipients
   - Add support for event-wide announcements

5. **Two-way SMS Communication**
   - Implement handling of SMS replies
   - Create a conversation view for two-way communication

### Technical Debt and Known Issues

1. **Testing**
   - Need comprehensive unit tests for SMS functionality
   - Should add integration tests for the entire booking flow

2. **Error Handling**
   - Improve error reporting for SMS failures
   - Add retry mechanism for failed SMS deliveries

3. **Performance**
   - Optimize SMS sending to avoid blocking the UI
   - Consider implementing a queue for high-volume SMS sending

4. **Documentation**
   - Create API documentation for the SMS service
   - Update user documentation with SMS feature details
