## Deployment

The application is deployed on Vercel with environment variables configured for Supabase integration.

## Development Process

- Git branching strategy with feature branches
- Each phase was developed in a dedicated branch
- All completed phases have been merged into main

## Next Steps: Phase 8 and Beyond

The next phase to implement is:

### Phase 8: Booking Confirmations

- Enhance the SMS confirmation flow
- Add SMS status tracking UI
- Handle SMS delivery status updates
- Add error handling for SMS failures

Subsequent phases include:

- Phase 9: SMS Reminders
- Phase 10: Booking Cancellations
- Phase 11: Event Cancellations

## How to Continue Development

1. Check out the main branch (which now contains all completed phases)
2. Create a new feature branch for Phase 8 (e.g., `phase-8-booking-confirmations`)
3. Follow the tasks defined in the implementation plan
4. Use the existing patterns for services, components, and pages
