## Next Steps

### Implementation Plan
A comprehensive implementation plan has been created to address all issues. Refer to `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN_V1.1.md` for details.

### Immediate Tasks (Priority Order)
1. **Fix Routing Structure**
   - Remove all traces of (dashboard) route group files
   - Ensure all page components use the AppLayout component consistently
   - Update route links throughout the application

2. **Fix Customer Management**
   - Repair customer listing API integration
   - Fix customer creation form submission
   - Implement proper customer deletion with confirmation

3. **Fix Events and Categories**
   - Repair event and category listing API integration
   - Fix form submissions and redirects
   - Implement proper deletion with confirmation
   - Restore detail views

4. **Fix Booking Management**
   - Repair booking creation form submission
   - Fix form redirections after submission
   - Implement proper editing and viewing

5. **Implement Dashboard Visualizations**
   - Add charts and graphs to the dashboard
   - Implement data analytics components

### Technical Approach
1. **Routing Issues**
   - Clear separation between regular routes and special route groups
   - Consistent use of the AppLayout component
   - Update all navigation links to point to valid routes

2. **API Connectivity**
   - Review and repair service functions
   - Add better error handling and feedback
   - Implement consistent loading states

3. **Form Handling**
   - Correct form submission processes
   - Implement consistent redirect patterns
   - Add better validation and error states

4. **Dashboard**
   - Add data visualization components
   - Implement analytics API endpoints
   - Create responsive chart layouts

   - `CategoryList`: List of categories
   - `CategoryView`: Detailed view of a category

3. UI Components
   - `Button`: Reusable button component
   - `Input`: Reusable input component
   - `FormGroup`: Form field wrapper
   - `Alert`: Error/success message component
   - `Spinner`: Loading indicator

4. Layout Components
   - `AppLayout`: Main application layout with authentication protection
   - `Sidebar`: Desktop navigation sidebar
   - `MobileNav`: Mobile bottom navigation
   - `PageHeader`: Consistent page header component

### Database Schema
1. Events Table
   - id: uuid (primary key)
   - title: text
   - description: text
   - start_time: timestamp
   - end_time: timestamp
   - capacity: integer
   - category_id: uuid (foreign key)
   - created_at: timestamp
   - updated_at: timestamp

2. Categories Table
   - id: uuid (primary key)
   - name: text
   - default_capacity: integer
