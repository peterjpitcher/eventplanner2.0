- **Next Phase**: Phase 3 (Customer Management - Basic)
- **GitHub Repository**: [https://github.com/peterjpitcher/eventplanner2.0.git](https://github.com/peterjpitcher/eventplanner2.0.git)
- **Development Server**: Running on http://localhost:3001

## Completed Phases

### Phase 1: Project Setup ✅

- Created Next.js project with TypeScript
- Configured Tailwind CSS
- Set up project structure
- Configured Supabase client
- Set up environment variables
- Configured ESLint
- Set up GitHub repository

### Phase 2: Authentication & Navigation ✅

- Implemented Supabase authentication
- Created login and registration pages
- Implemented authentication context and hooks
- Added route protection for authenticated routes
- Created responsive navigation (desktop sidebar and mobile bottom navigation)
- Implemented user profile management

## Repository Status

- **Main Branch**: Contains Phase 1 implementation
- **Phase-2-Clean Branch**: Contains Phase 2 implementation
- **Important Note**: A PR needs to be created from `phase-2-clean` to `main` and merged through GitHub's interface due to GitHub's secret scanning detecting potential secrets in the commit history.

## Key Components

### Authentication

- **Auth Context**: `src/contexts/auth-context.tsx` - React context for auth state management
- **RequireAuth Hook**: `src/hooks/use-require-auth.ts` - Hook for route protection
- **Auth Forms**: `src/components/auth/login-form.tsx` and `src/components/auth/register-form.tsx`

### Navigation

- **Desktop Sidebar**: `src/components/navigation/sidebar.tsx`
- **Mobile Navigation**: `src/components/navigation/mobile-nav.tsx`
- **Dashboard Layout**: `src/app/(dashboard)/layout.tsx` - Authenticated layout with navigation

### UI Components

- **Button**: `src/components/ui/button.tsx`
- **Input**: `src/components/ui/input.tsx`

## Environment Configuration

- A template environment file is available at `.env.local.example`
- Local development requires:
  - Supabase URL and anon key
  - (Later phases) Twilio credentials

## Next Steps: Phase 3 - Customer Management

### Planned Tasks:

1. Create Supabase tables for customers
2. Implement customer list view
3. Create customer creation form with validation
4. Implement mobile number formatting and validation
5. Add customer detail view
6. Implement customer editing
7. Add customer deletion functionality
8. Implement basic customer search

### Technical Considerations:

- Database schema needs to be carefully designed to support future SMS features
- Mobile number validation is critical for SMS functionality in later phases
- Consider implementing optimistic UI updates for better user experience

## Development Environment

- **Node.js**: v18.17.0 or later
- **Package Manager**: npm
- **Development Server**: http://localhost:3001
- **Required Accounts**:
  - Supabase account (for authentication and database)
  - Twilio account (will be needed for Phase 7 - SMS Integration)
