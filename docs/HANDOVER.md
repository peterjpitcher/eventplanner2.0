4. **events** - Event details linked to categories

All tables have Row Level Security (RLS) policies configured to ensure users can only access their own data.

```

## Deployment

The application is deployed on Vercel with environment variables configured for Supabase integration.

## Development Process

- Git branching strategy with feature branches
- Each phase was developed in a dedicated branch
- All completed phases have been merged into main

## Next Steps: Phase 6 and Beyond

The next phase to implement is:

### Phase 6: Booking Management

- Create database schema for event registrations
- Implement registration service layer
- Create UI for managing registrations
- Implement attendance tracking
- Add reporting functionality

Subsequent phases include:

- Phase 7: SMS Integration
- Phase 8: Email Integration
- Phase 9: Payment Integration
- Phase 10: Advanced Reporting

## How to Continue Development

1. Check out the main branch (which now contains all completed phases)
2. Create a new feature branch for Phase 6 (e.g., `phase-6-booking-management`)
3. Follow the tasks defined in the implementation plan
4. Use the existing patterns for services, components, and pages
