# Event Planner 2.0 Implementation Plan v1.3

## Issues Summary

Based on additional testing, the following issues have been identified:

1. **Upcoming Events Component**: Dashboard shows no upcoming events despite them being present in the database.
2. **Customer Deletion**: Customers appear to delete in the UI but remain in the database, reappearing on refresh.
3. **Booking Creation**: "Could not find 'SendNotification' column" error when adding bookings from the event detail page.
4. **Mobile Experience**: Overall mobile UI needs improvement, particularly:
   - Dashboard not optimized for mobile
   - Categories menu item in sticky mobile menu
   - Table layouts not mobile-friendly
5. **Date and Time Format**: Inconsistent date/time formatting across the application.
6. **Twilio API Configuration**: Missing configuration for SMS functionality.

## Root Cause Analysis

1. **Upcoming Events**: The event query may be filtering events incorrectly or there may be data transformation issues.
2. **Customer Deletion**: The optimistic UI update happens but the database operation is failing silently.
3. **Booking Creation**: Column name mismatch in the database schema vs. the application code.
4. **Mobile Experience**: Current UI designed primarily for desktop without sufficient mobile optimization.
5. **Date/Time Format**: Format not standardized across components.
6. **Twilio Config**: Environment variables not properly set up.

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Fix Critical Data Operations (Priority: Highest)

**Objective**: Fix database operations for customer deletion and booking creation

#### Technical Details:

1. **Customer Deletion Fix**:
   - Debug the `customerService.deleteCustomer()` function to identify why deletion appears to work but doesn't persist
   - Verify transactional integrity of delete operations
   - Add more specific error handling for constraint errors
   - Update UI to properly reflect the database state after deletion

2. **Booking Creation Fix**:
   - Investigate the "SendNotification" column error
   - Update database schema or application code to align column naming
   - Ensure all form fields are properly validated before submission
   - Add specific error handling for schema-related errors

#### Testing Criteria:
- Customer deletion successfully removes entries permanently
- Customer list properly refreshes after deletion
- Bookings can be created without errors from event detail page
- Created bookings appear in the booking list

**Estimated Time**: 1 day
**Dependencies**: None
**Key Files**:

## Risk Management

### Potential Risks:

1. **Database Schema Issues**: Column naming conventions may require broader changes
   - Mitigation: Carefully plan schema updates to minimize disruption

2. **Mobile Responsiveness Trade-offs**: Some complex tables may be challenging to display on mobile
   - Mitigation: Consider progressive disclosure patterns for complex data

3. **Twilio Configuration Dependencies**: SMS functionality depends on external service availability
   - Mitigation: Implement robust fallbacks and clear error messages

4. **Date/Time Timezone Complexity**: Date handling across timezones can introduce bugs
   - Mitigation: Implement consistent server-side handling of timezones
