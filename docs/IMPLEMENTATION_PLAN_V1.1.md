# Event Planner 2.0 Implementation Plan v1.1

## Issues Summary

Based on testing in production, the following critical issues have been identified:

1. **Dashboard**: Missing graphs and charts; only shows navigation buttons
2. **Customers**: 404 error when creating, viewing, or editing; Delete function prompts but doesn't execute
3. **Categories**: 404 error on all operations
4. **Events**: 404 error on all operations
5. **Bookings**: Page loads, but creating a booking reloads the page; 404 errors for viewing and editing bookings
6. **Route Structure**: Route conflicts between regular routes and (dashboard) route group

## Root Causes Analysis

1. **Routing Issues**: The application has duplicate routes from the migration of /(dashboard) route group to regular routes
2. **API Integration**: Service functions may be failing to connect to the backend properly
3. **Form Handling**: Form submissions may be improperly configured, causing navigation issues
4. **AppLayout Component**: The AppLayout component might not be properly wrapping all necessary pages
5. **Missing API Implementations**: Some API endpoints may be missing or improperly implemented
6. **Dashboard Component**: Missing chart components for the dashboard

## Success Criteria

The implementation will be considered successful when:

1. All 404 errors are resolved
2. All CRUD operations work as expected for customers, events, categories, and bookings
3. Dashboard displays appropriate charts and statistics
4. All forms properly submit and redirect
5. Delete operations function correctly with proper confirmation
6. Mobile functionality works as expected
7. No regression bugs are introduced

## Risk Management

### Potential Risks:

1. **Database Schema Issues**: Schema inconsistencies might be causing some API failures
   - Mitigation: Review and align database schema with application models

2. **Third-party Service Failures**: Twilio or other services might be failing
   - Mitigation: Implement proper fallbacks and error handling

3. **Deployment Issues**: Changes might not correctly deploy to production
   - Mitigation: Create detailed deployment checklist and verification steps

4. **Regression Bugs**: Fixing one issue might create another
   - Mitigation: Implement comprehensive testing after each phase
