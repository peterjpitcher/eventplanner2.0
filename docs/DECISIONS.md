# Project Decisions

This document captures key decisions made during the development of the Event Management System, along with the reasoning behind them.

## Architecture & Technology Stack

### Frontend Framework
- **Decision**: Use Next.js with App Router and TypeScript
- **Reasoning**: Next.js provides server-side rendering capabilities, API routes, and excellent TypeScript integration. The App Router provides a modern, more intuitive routing system with improved layouts and loading states.
- **Alternatives Considered**: React with React Router, Remix, Astro
- **Date**: [Implementation Date]

### Styling
- **Decision**: Use Tailwind CSS
- **Reasoning**: Tailwind CSS enables rapid UI development with utility classes and a consistent design system. It integrates well with Next.js and provides excellent responsiveness capabilities.
- **Alternatives Considered**: CSS Modules, Styled Components, Emotion
- **Date**: [Implementation Date]

### Backend & Database
- **Decision**: Use Supabase for authentication, database, and storage
- **Reasoning**: Supabase provides a comprehensive backend solution with PostgreSQL database, authentication services, and storage capabilities. Its real-time features are beneficial for booking management.
- **Alternatives Considered**: Firebase, custom Node.js backend with PostgreSQL
- **Date**: [Implementation Date]

### Communication Service
- **Decision**: Use Twilio for SMS messaging
- **Reasoning**: Twilio offers reliable SMS services with good documentation and a straightforward API. It supports two-way messaging needed for booking confirmations and cancellations.
- **Alternatives Considered**: MessageBird, Vonage (formerly Nexmo)
- **Date**: [Implementation Date]

## Project Structure

### Code Organization
- **Decision**: Organize code by feature within the app directory
- **Reasoning**: Feature-based organization improves maintainability as the application grows. The App Router structure supports this approach with route groups and layouts.
- **Alternatives Considered**: Organization by technical role (components, hooks, etc.)
- **Date**: [Implementation Date]

### Component Architecture
- **Decision**: Use a combination of server and client components based on requirements
- **Reasoning**: Server components reduce JavaScript sent to the client and improve initial page load. Client components are used where interactivity and client-side state are needed.
- **Alternatives Considered**: Primarily client-side components
- **Date**: [Implementation Date]

## Feature Decisions

### Authentication
- **Decision**: Use Supabase authentication with email/password
- **Reasoning**: Supabase provides a secure, easy to implement authentication system that integrates directly with the database.
- **Alternatives Considered**: NextAuth.js, Firebase Authentication
- **Date**: [Implementation Phase 2]

### Mobile Experience
- **Decision**: Use responsive design with mobile-specific navigation components
- **Reasoning**: Responsive design ensures compatibility across devices. Mobile-specific navigation components provide better usability on small screens.
- **Alternatives Considered**: Separate mobile app, mobile-first approach
- **Date**: [Implementation Phase 15]

### SMS Integration
- **Decision**: Implement SMS via Twilio API with serverless functions
- **Reasoning**: Serverless functions provide a secure way to handle Twilio API keys and send messages. They can be scheduled or triggered by events.
- **Alternatives Considered**: Dedicated backend service, third-party integration services
- **Date**: [Implementation Phase 7]

## Development Workflow

### Version Control
- **Decision**: Use Git with GitHub and feature branch workflow
- **Reasoning**: Feature branches allow for isolated development and code review before merging to main.
- **Alternatives Considered**: Trunk-based development
- **Date**: [Implementation Date]

### Deployment
- **Decision**: Use Vercel for hosting and CI/CD
- **Reasoning**: Vercel provides excellent integration with Next.js, automatic previews for pull requests, and simplified deployment workflows.
- **Alternatives Considered**: Netlify, AWS Amplify
- **Date**: [Implementation Date]

## Phase 1 Implementation Decisions

### Next.js Setup
- **Decision**: Used create-next-app with TypeScript, ESLint, and Tailwind CSS
- **Reasoning**: This configuration provides a solid foundation with type safety, code quality tools, and efficient styling capabilities.
- **Date**: [Current Date]

### Project Structure
- **Decision**: Created a modular directory structure with separate folders for components, lib, and app pages
- **Reasoning**: This organization improves code maintainability and makes it easier to locate and update code as the project grows.
- **Date**: [Current Date]

### Environment Variables
- **Decision**: Created a comprehensive .env.local.example file with placeholders for all required API keys
- **Reasoning**: This provides clear documentation on what environment variables are needed and prevents accidental commitment of secret keys to the repository.
- **Date**: [Current Date]

### Supabase Integration
- **Decision**: Set up a utility file for Supabase client initialization
- **Reasoning**: This centralizes Supabase connection logic and ensures consistent client usage throughout the application.
- **Date**: [Current Date]

### Git Configuration
- **Decision**: Created a comprehensive .gitignore file and GitHub PR template
- **Reasoning**: The .gitignore prevents unnecessary files from being committed, while the PR template standardizes contribution information and review processes.
- **Date**: [Current Date]
