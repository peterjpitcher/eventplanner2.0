# Development Workflow

## Database Migrations
- All database changes must be made through migration scripts
- Migration scripts are located in `docs/migrations/`
- Migration scripts must be reviewed and executed by the project owner
- Each migration script should include:
  - Clear description of changes
  - Rollback procedures where applicable
  - Data migration steps if needed
- Project owner maintains a record of executed migrations
- No automated database changes are implemented
- Migration scripts should be tested in a development environment first

## Development Process
1. Create a new branch for your feature
2. Make changes and commit regularly
3. Push changes to remote repository
4. Create a pull request
5. Address any review comments
6. Merge to main branch
7. Deploy to production

## Code Style
- Follow TypeScript best practices
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add comments for complex logic
- Keep functions small and focused
- Use proper error handling

## Testing
- Write unit tests for new features
- Test edge cases
- Ensure all tests pass before merging
- Test in development environment

## Deployment
- Deploy to staging first
- Verify changes in staging
- Deploy to production
- Monitor for any issues

## Documentation
- Update relevant documentation
- Add comments to complex code
- Update API documentation
- Keep README up to date
