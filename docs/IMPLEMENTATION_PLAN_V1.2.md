# Event Planner 2.0 Implementation Plan v1.2

## Issues Summary

Based on testing in production, the following critical issues have been identified:

1. **Dashboard**: Fails to load data, displaying a "Please try again later" error. Navigation links at the bottom need removal.
2. **Customer Profiles**: Delete functionality isn't working correctly - shows confirmation but doesn't remove entries.
3. **Event Categories**: Works properly but needs to be removed from main navigation and added as a button on Events page.
4. **Events Page**: Needs event bookings list at the bottom of event details.
5. **Bookings**: 404 errors when viewing bookings, seat number updates failing, and delete functionality not working.
6. **Messages Page**: Missing left navigation which needs to be added back.

## Root Causes Analysis

1. **Dashboard Data Loading**: API calls for dashboard statistics likely failing, possibly due to missing handlers or database queries.
2. **Customer Deletion**: Delete function likely not properly connected to the database or missing proper state updates.
3. **Navigation Structure**: Menu structure needs reorganization for better UX flow.
4. **Booking Management**: Multiple issues including routing problems, data validation, and state management after operations.
5. **UI Consistency**: Messages page has inconsistent layout compared to other sections.

## Implementation Plan

     - "Manage Events"
     - "Booking Management" 
     - "Customer Directory"
     - "Event Categories"
   - Add loading fallbacks to show partial data if only certain metrics fail to load
   - Improve error messaging to be more specific about what failed

3. **Dashboard Cache Management**:
   - Implement a caching strategy for dashboard data to improve performance
