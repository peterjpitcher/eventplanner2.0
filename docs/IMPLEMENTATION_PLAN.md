2. **Development**: Implement the features according to the plan
3. **Testing**: Verify functionality works as expected
4. **Documentation**: Update relevant documentation
5. **Git Commit**: Create a specific commit for the phase completion with proper version tagging
6. **Deployment**: Deploy to Vercel for preview
7. **Review**: Conduct review and gather feedback
8. **Refinement**: Address feedback and make improvements
9. **Production**: Merge to main branch and deploy to production

## Risk Management

Potential risks and mitigation strategies:

1. **Twilio Integration Complexity**: Begin SMS integration early with a simple proof-of-concept to identify issues.
2. **Mobile/Desktop Feature Separation**: Create clear abstractions for platform-specific features early in development.
3. **Supabase Data Model Changes**: Design database schema carefully upfront and use migrations for any changes.
4. **Performance Issues**: Implement regular performance testing throughout development.
5. **Timeline Slippage**: Include buffer time in the schedule and prioritize features by importance.

## Success Criteria

The implementation will be considered successful when:

1. All specified functionality is implemented correctly
2. The application performs well on both mobile and desktop
3. SMS notifications are delivered reliably
4. Users can effectively manage customers, events, and bookings
5. Documentation is complete and accurate
6. The system is deployed to production and accessible to users
