### Database Updates

1. **SMS Messages Table**:

   - Used for both confirmations and reminders

2. **Bookings Table**:
   - Added columns for tracking reminder status:
     - `reminder_7day_sent` (boolean)
     - `reminder_24hr_sent` (boolean)

3. **SMS Message Types**:
   - Added enum values for different message types:
     - `booking_confirmation`
     - `booking_cancellation`
     - `event_cancellation`
     - `reminder_7day`
     - `reminder_24hr`

### Deployment Instructions

To deploy the complete SMS functionality including the reminder system:

1. **Database Migration**:
   - Run the SQL script in `supabase/migrations/20240327_reminders.sql`
   - This adds the necessary columns to the bookings table and updates the message type enum

2. **Environment Variables**:
   - In Vercel (or your deployment platform), add:
     - `API_AUTH_TOKEN`: A secure random string (e.g., `a1b2c3d4e5f6g7h8i9j0k1l2m3n4o5p6q7r8s9t0`)
     - `SKIP_API_AUTH`: Set to `false` in production
     - `SMS_PROVIDER`: Set to either `mockSms` or `twilio`
     - If using Twilio, add your credentials:
       - `TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID`
       - `TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN`
       - `TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER`

3. **GitHub Secrets**:
   - In your GitHub repository settings, add:
     - `API_AUTH_TOKEN`: Same value as in your environment variables
     - `API_BASE_URL`: Your production URL (e.g., `https://eventplanner2-0.vercel.app`)

4. **GitHub Actions**:
   - The workflow file is already set up in `.github/workflows/process-reminders.yml`
   - It will run automatically every day at 8:00 AM UTC
   - You can manually trigger it from the Actions tab in GitHub

### Testing the Reminder System

To verify that the reminder system is working:

1. **Manual API Test**:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST https://your-app-url/api/reminders/process \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer your_api_auth_token" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json"
   ```

2. **Manual Reminders**:
   - Navigate to a booking detail page
   - Use the "Send Reminder" button to manually trigger a reminder
   - Check the SMS status indicator to verify delivery

3. **Automated Workflow**:
   - Trigger the GitHub Action manually from the Actions tab
   - Check the workflow run logs to verify successful execution

### Next Steps

1. Begin **Phase 6: Monitoring Dashboard**:
   - Create SMS activity dashboard
   - Implement message log viewer
   - Add system status indicators

2. Complete **Phase 7: Testing and Documentation**:
   - Add end-to-end tests for critical SMS flows
   - Finalize all documentation
   - Clean up code and optimize queries

### Technical Debt & Known Issues

1. **Error Handling Standardization**:
   - Need to standardize error handling across all SMS-related services
   - Currently, some error handling is inconsistent

2. **Rate Limiting**:
   - Need to implement proper rate limiting for SMS sending
   - Currently relies on provider rate limits

3. **Testing**:
   - Need more comprehensive testing, especially for edge cases
   - Should add automated tests for critical SMS flows

### Environment Configuration
Added new environment variables:
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SMS_ENABLED`: Toggle to enable/disable SMS functionality
