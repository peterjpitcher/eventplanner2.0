# Implementation Plan v1.4

## Overview

This implementation plan addresses several critical issues identified during testing of the Event Planner 2.0 application. We'll focus on fixing persistent bugs that are preventing core functionality from working correctly and make UI improvements to enhance the user experience.

## Issues Summary

1. **Customer Deletion Issue**: Customers cannot be deleted despite the database operation succeeding.
2. **Dashboard Upcoming Events**: Events are not displaying on the dashboard.
3. **Category Deletion Issue**: Categories cannot be deleted.
4. **Navigation Issues**: 
   - Category item appearing in left navigation despite being removed previously.
   - Messages appearing in the left navigation when it should be removed.
5. **SMS Functionality**: Booking creation isn't triggering SMS notifications.
6. **SMS Templates Management**: Add button on SMS templates page to test messages.

## Phase 1: Fix Customer Deletion (Critical)

### Detailed Analysis
The customer deletion issue appears to be a problem with how Supabase handles the DELETE operation response. While the DELETE operation completes successfully on the database, the response handling in our code incorrectly interprets the response as an error when no data is returned.

### Implementation Tasks

1. **Investigate Supabase DELETE Response**:
   - Debug the full response from Supabase DELETE operations using console logging
   - Check the Supabase documentation for expected behavior of DELETE with .select()

2. **Update Customer Service**:
   - Modify the deleteCustomer method in customer-service.ts to correctly handle the Supabase response
   - Test alternative approaches if the current .select() method isn't returning expected data
   - Implement error checking that properly distinguishes between actual errors and successful deletions

3. **Add Transaction Support**:
   - Implement transaction support for customer deletion to ensure atomicity
   - Add a validation step after deletion to confirm success

## Phase 2: Fix Dashboard Upcoming Events (High Priority)

### Detailed Analysis
The dashboard's upcoming events query is likely not returning results due to issues with date/time handling or SQL query structure. 

### Implementation Tasks

1. **Debug Dashboard Service**:
   - Add comprehensive logging to trace the execution path of the getDashboardStats method
   - Log the SQL queries being generated and their responses
   - Test the query directly in Supabase to verify expected results

2. **Refactor Events Query**:
   - Rewrite the upcoming events query to use simpler, more reliable filtering
   - Use a single date comparison for filtering rather than complex time calculations
   - Ensure proper date format conversion consistent with Supabase expectations

3. **Implement Fallback Mechanism**:
   - Add a fallback query that fetches recent events if the upcoming events query fails
   - Implement client-side filtering as a backup to server-side filtering

## Phase 3: Fix Category Deletion (High Priority)

### Detailed Analysis
Categories cannot be deleted likely due to similar issues with the Supabase DELETE operation response handling or foreign key constraints not being properly checked or handled.

### Implementation Tasks

1. **Investigate Foreign Key Constraints**:
   - Check the database schema for any foreign key relationships to the categories table
   - Add logging to trace which specific step in the category deletion process is failing

2. **Update Category Service**:
   - Modify the deleteCategory method to handle Supabase responses correctly
   - Implement better pre-deletion checks to identify and report any constraint violations
   - Add more informative error messages to help users understand why deletion might fail

3. **Improve UI Feedback**:
   - Enhance error messaging in the UI for category deletion failures
   - Add confirmation dialogs with clear information about potential consequences

## Phase 4: Fix Navigation Issues (Medium Priority)

### Detailed Analysis
There are inconsistencies in the navigation structure, with both the Categories and Messages items appearing in places where they shouldn't.

### Implementation Tasks

1. **Update Sidebar Navigation**:
   - Remove Categories item from the sidebar navigation
   - Remove Messages from sidebar navigation
   - Ensure navigation items are consistent between desktop and mobile views

2. **Update SMS Templates Page**:
   - Add a "View Messages" button to the SMS Templates page
   - Implement navigation from the SMS Templates page to the Messages page

3. **Refactor Navigation Component**:
   - Clean up the navigation data structure to prevent duplicate entries
   - Implement a more maintainable way to manage navigation items

## Phase 5: Fix SMS Notifications (Critical)

### Detailed Analysis
SMS notifications aren't being triggered when bookings are created. This could be due to environment variable issues, Twilio integration problems, or logic errors in the booking creation process.

### Implementation Tasks

1. **Debug SMS Sending**:
   - Add comprehensive logging throughout the SMS sending process
   - Check if the SMS_ENABLED flag is being correctly read from environment variables
   - Verify that Twilio credentials are properly loaded and authenticated

2. **Fix Booking Service**:
   - Update the createBooking method to ensure the SMS notification flag is properly processed
   - Check that the customer and event data is correctly joined before attempting to send SMS
   - Add explicit error handling for SMS sending failures

3. **Implement SMS Testing Feature**:
   - Add a test button on the SMS Templates page to send test messages
   - Create a test SMS sending function that doesn't require a booking
   - Add logging for all SMS operations to help with debugging

## Phase 6: Enhance SMS Templates Management (Medium Priority)

### Detailed Analysis
The SMS Templates page needs additional functionality to test message templates and provide better user feedback.

### Implementation Tasks

1. **Add Test Message Feature**:
   - Create a "Test Message" button on the SMS Templates page
   - Implement a form to send test messages with placeholder data
   - Add feedback mechanism to show delivery status

2. **Improve Template Editing**:
   - Add syntax highlighting for placeholders in the template editor
   - Add validation to ensure all required placeholders are present
   - Provide a preview feature to show how templates will appear with sample data

3. **Add Template Management Features**:
   - Implement template version history
   - Add ability to create new custom templates
   - Add template restore/reset functionality

## Testing Strategy

For each fix, implement the following testing:

1. **Unit Testing**:
   - Test each modified service method with various input scenarios
   - Verify correct handling of edge cases and error conditions

2. **Integration Testing**:
   - Test the complete flow from UI action to database operation
   - Verify that data changes are correctly reflected in the UI

3. **Error Handling Testing**:
   - Deliberately trigger error conditions to verify proper handling
   - Check error messages for clarity and actionability

## Success Criteria

1. **Customer Deletion**: Users can successfully delete customers without error messages
2. **Dashboard**: Upcoming events are correctly displayed on the dashboard
3. **Category Deletion**: Categories can be deleted when they have no associated events
4. **Navigation**: Navigation sidebar no longer shows Categories or Messages items
5. **SMS Templates**: SMS Templates page includes a "View Messages" button
6. **SMS Notifications**: New bookings successfully trigger SMS notifications
7. **SMS Testing**: Users can test SMS templates from the Templates page
