## Git Workflow

We follow a feature branch workflow:

1. Create a feature branch from `main` using the naming convention: `feature/feature-name` or `fix/issue-description`
2. Make changes in your branch
3. Submit a pull request to `main`
4. Ensure CI passes
5. Obtain code review approval
6. Merge to `main`

## Development Process

1. **Requirements Analysis**: Review the specifications in the [PRD](../specifications/PRD.md)
2. **Task Breakdown**: Break down features into manageable tasks
3. **Implementation**: Develop the feature following our coding standards
4. **Testing**: Write and run tests
5. **Documentation**: Update relevant documentation
6. **Review**: Submit for code review

## Code Review Process

All code changes must go through a review process:

1. Create a pull request with a clear description of changes
2. Assign reviewers
3. Address any feedback
4. Obtain approval before merging

## Testing Workflow

1. Write unit tests for new functionality
2. Ensure all existing tests pass
3. Perform manual testing for UI components
4. For critical features, add integration tests

## Deployment Process

We use a continuous deployment approach with Vercel:

1. **Development**: Local development and testing
2. **Staging**: Automatic deployment from `main` branch to staging environment
3. **Production**: Manual promotion from staging to production after QA approval

## Documentation Standards

- Keep documentation up-to-date with code changes
- Document all major components, APIs, and workflows
- Use clear, concise language and provide examples where appropriate
- Store documentation in the appropriate directories within the `docs` folder
