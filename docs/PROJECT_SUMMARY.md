# Event Management System - Project Summary

## Project Overview

The Event Management System is a web application designed to help pub owners and managers efficiently organize events, manage customer bookings, and automate SMS communications. The system prioritizes simplicity, mobile optimization, and intuitive workflows to streamline the event management process.

## Key Features

- **Customer Management**: Registration, profile management, and search functionality
- **Event Management**: Categorization, scheduling, and capacity management
- **Booking System**: Simple booking creation and management
- **SMS Notifications**: Automated messaging for bookings, reminders, and cancellations
- **SMS Reply Handling**: Processing and displaying customer responses

## Technical Architecture

The system is built using a modern serverless architecture:

- **Frontend**: React with Tailwind CSS, deployed on Vercel
- **Backend**: Supabase for database, authentication, and API
- **SMS Integration**: Twilio for sending and receiving SMS messages

## Development Approach

Our development approach emphasizes:

- **Mobile-First Design**: Ensuring an optimal experience on mobile devices
- **Component Reusability**: Building modular components for consistency
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Core functionality works on all devices with enhancements for modern browsers
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Multi-layered testing strategy to ensure reliability
- **Continuous Documentation**: Documentation developed alongside code

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following key areas:

- **Frontend Components**: Reusable UI elements organized by feature
- **API Integration**: Supabase and Twilio integration logic
- **State Management**: React context-based state management
- **Utility Functions**: Shared helper functions and data processing
- **Testing**: Unit, integration, and end-to-end tests

## Database Design

The database schema consists of six primary entities:

- **Customers**: Customer information and contact details
- **Event Categories**: Reusable templates for event types
- **Events**: Scheduled events with details and capacity
- **Bookings**: Customer registrations for events
- **SMS Messages**: Records of sent messages
- **SMS Replies**: Customer SMS responses

All data will be retained indefinitely within Supabase's storage limits, with no automatic archiving or deletion.

## Authentication Approach

The system uses a simplified authentication model:
- Single account shared between the pub owner and partner
- Email/password authentication
- No complex user roles or permissions
- Supabase Auth for secure authentication management

## SMS Notifications

The system includes several predefined SMS templates:
- Booking confirmations
- Booking reminders (7 days before using day name, and 24 hours before)
- Booking cancellations (with confirmation dialog)
- Event cancellations (with confirmation dialog)

Templates are stored as constants and not editable through the UI. All templates use "The Anchor" as the signature.

## Mobile vs Desktop Functionality

Most core features are available on both mobile and desktop, with the following exceptions:

**Desktop-Only Features**:
- Customer data import
- System settings and administration
- Dashboard statistics and reporting
- Event deletion
- Event category management
- Bulk operations

The mobile interface uses a bottom sticky menu for navigation, while desktop uses a sidebar layout. A detailed breakdown of which features are available on which platforms is documented in the Mobile Functionality Decision List.

## Implementation Plan

The system will be developed in 17 progressive phases over a 12-week timeline, with each phase building upon the previous ones. Each phase includes specific deliverables and will be deployed to Vercel for preview/production. See the [Implementation Plan](./IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md) for detailed breakdown of phases and tasks.

## Documentation

Comprehensive documentation has been created to support the development and usage of the system:

- **Architecture Documentation**: System design and technical decisions
- **API Documentation**: Endpoint specifications and usage
- **Database Schema**: Table structure and relationships
- **Setup Guide**: Installation and configuration instructions
- **User Guides**: End-user documentation for system operation
- **Development Workflows**: Processes for ongoing development
- **SMS Templates**: Predefined message templates for various notifications
- **Mobile Functionality**: Specification of features available on mobile vs. desktop
- **Implementation Plan**: Phased approach to development with timeline

## Deployment Strategy

The application will be deployed using a continuous deployment approach:

1. **Development Environment**: For active development and testing
2. **Staging Environment**: For pre-release verification
3. **Production Environment**: For end-user access

## Next Steps

Before beginning implementation, we need to:

1. Finalize the technical specifications based on the clarifications provided
2. Set up the initial development environment
3. Create the project skeleton and infrastructure
4. Implement the database schema with mobile number standardization

Once these steps are complete, we can begin implementing the core functionality of the system according to the phased approach outlined in the Implementation Plan.
