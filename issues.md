# Issues and Future Improvements

## Current Issues

1. In the `/events` edit view, the date and time selectors could be improved for better user experience.
2. The "Add Customers via Excel Import" feature is not fully implemented yet.
3. Implement form validation for all forms (events, customers, categories).
4. Testing should be implemented for all components and pages.
5. Improve dashboard with event analytics.
6. In the booking form, update the seats/reminder dropdown to allow typing a number instead of selecting from a combo box. This would improve user experience when booking large numbers of seats.

## Resolved Issues

1. ~~Events created through the UI aren't showing up in the events list.~~ (Fixed)
